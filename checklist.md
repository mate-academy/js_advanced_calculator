1.  [NAMING] - Use proper names for variables. If function was called `makeFruit`, it should return `fruit`
2.  [NAMING] - use proper names for variables - if you want to name variable result, pick a better one :)
3.  [CODE STYLE] - use arithmetic operators with assignment operator `=` if you want to add something to existing value

BAD EXAMPLE:
```
let a = 1;

a = a + 2;
```

GOOD EXAMPLE: 
```
let a = 1;

a += 2;
```
4. [CODE KNOWLEDGE] - if you creating a method in the object, you don't need to use function keyword, use shortcut instead.


BAD EXAMPLE: 
```
 methodName: function() {
 // your code
},
```

GOOD EXAMPLE:
```
 methodName() {
 // your code
},
```
